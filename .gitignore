Why remove the leading slashes? That's a mistake. The phrase "because relative paths" leads me to believe you don't understand how .gitignore works. /Library/ is correct, for example, as you want to ignore the top-level Library directory in the repo.

The top level in the repo, not the filesystem.

You don't want /Assets/Scripts/Library/MyCode.cs ignored.

So I'd suggest this .gitignore file is broken.

I actually have no idea if 2017 makes any difference, but I just wanted to make sure.

I've been referring to this, which covers gitignores for Unity, Mac and Windows, and some other related git stuff

The only major difference wrt source control in 2017 as far as I know is that new projects default to the "Force Text" asset serialization mode, which is a good thing. Other than that I don't think the folder structure changed at all.
